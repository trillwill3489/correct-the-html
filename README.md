# Introduction to Programming Exercise - Correct the HTML

I should have included my updates throughout the project here. Luckily, I did leave descriptiive notes in my commits, which should help me break down what I did. I am also getting used to the commit chonological timeline that shows what changes were made and when. I started simply with the heading section: changing the div for the header into a header element. XXX Next, I worked on the paragraph elements. My first thought was to group all of the individual paragraph sections together into one paragraph element. The webpage did not match the original code, so I changed it back to giving each paragraph its own paragraph element without using div. XXX Next, I worked on the image. I do not have a commit of it, but I tried removing the div completely and just leaving the <img> code in there alone. This cause the pic to inflate accross the entire screen. Instead, I used my resources and found that 'figure' is good to use for images. XXX Trying to finalize the project, I just had to switch the div's for the main section and article section. However, I did have one last issue: The heading 'h1' for the article was smaller than it was in the original. XXX It took some messing around but I ultimately found the answer. Moving the image and the heading outside of the article brackets but still within the main brackets completed my assignment!

## Overview
In this assignment, you will update the tags inside `index.html`. Think carefully about which HTML element should be used if there is a need to update it. The content inside the tags can help you determine which tag you should use or if it needs to be changed at all. Remember to use semantic HTML tags when updating the document where appropriate. If you make the changes correctly, the page will look the same as it did before any changes were made.

Remember to update the closing tags when changing an element.
